# Cljs + React Hooks

# History lesson

```clojure
(defprotocol ReactLifecycle
  (component-did-mount [this])
  (component-did-update [this prev-props prev-state snapshot])
  (component-will-unmount [this])
  (should-component-update [this next-props next-state])
  (component-did-mount [this])
  (component-will-receive-props [this next-props])
  (component-will-update [this next-state])
  (render [this]))

;; methods called from within your component
(defprotocol ReactComponent
  (set-state [this updater callback])
  (force-update [this])
  (props [this])
  (state [this]))
```

---

# State in React (originally)

* React intended as the V in 'MVC'
* OO-design
* With mutable state, `should-component-update` becomes a tricky question...
* Flux application architecture an early solution for managing state

---

# State in cljs+React (originally)

* Clojure community saw how React could be used to leverage functional programming paradigms
* Leveraged Clojure's persistent data structures + notion of state
* Leveraged React's virtual DOM to provide an efficient means to re-render between state changes
* If data is immutable, re-rendering is as simple as a diff between states
* `ui = f(state)`

---

# State in cljs (early implementations)

* Om classic: cursors 
  * Global app state as atom, cursor is a path to some state (`transact!`, `update!` etc)

* Reagent: ratoms 
  * Implementation of Clojure's atom to trigger re-renders of components based on state change

---

# React functional components (JS)

* 90% of the time you don't need the overhead/complexity of lifecycles, local state
* The `render` method in the component lifecycle
* State management handled by external libraries (redux/etc)

---

# What is React hooks?

* Native API for dealing with state in functional components
* Two fns in the API that are relevant to cljs: `useState` and `useEffect`

---

# Use state

* `use-state(initial-value) -> [current-value, setter-fn]`
* Can only be declared at the top level of a component (and not within conditionals, for loops, etc) 
* useState == Reagent's ratoms?

```clojure
;; Reagent
(defn component []
  ;; Declared at the top-level, closed over the component requiring state
  (let [name (reagent.core/atom "Todd")
    (fn [] 
      [:div {:on-click #(reset! name "Cindy")} "Hello " @name])))

;; Hooks
(defn component []
  ;; Declared at the top-level of a component
  (let [[name set-name] (React/useState "Todd")
    [:div {:on-click #(set-name "Cindy")} "Hello " name]))
```

---

# Use Effect

* `use-effect(effect-fn)`
* Imperative escape hatch
* Can only be declared at the top level of a component (and not within conditionals, for loops, etc) 
* Called after initial render (`component-did-mount`)
* Optional return fn called on unmount (`component-will-unmount`)

```
(defn tick []
  (let [[curr-tick set-tick] (React/useState 0)]
    (React/useEffect 
      (fn []
        (let [ticker (js/setTimeout #(set-tick (inc curr-tick)) 3000)]
          #(js/clearTimeout ticker))))

    [:div "Tick... " curr-tick]))
```

---

# Use Effect

* Optionally takes a second argument, which is a collection of dependencies
* Effect will be called if value of dependencies change after each render
* Crude, and uses javascript equality to detect dependency changes :(

```
(defn tick []
  (let [[curr-name set-name] (React/useState curr-name)]
    (React/useEffect 
      (fn []
        (.log js/console "Name changed to:" curr-name)
        #(.log js/console "Unmounting"))
      [curr-name])

    [:div "Hello... " curr-name]))
```

---

# So... Javascript has Reagent?

## Why even cljs?

* Persistent data structures + `clojure.core` api for using them
* State management (in the form of atoms)
* Rich tooling/compiler/etc (shadow-cljs, figwheel main)
* Hiccup templating

---

# Functions, the ultimate abstraction?

* A functional interface to React's class-based design was non-trivial
  * Reagent's implementation of ratoms, components, etc

* While React's implementation (under the hood) of hooks is probably complex, the functional API it exposes allows Cljs developers the ability to implement Reagent (or re-frame) trivially 

* Hooks can be a composable building block for higher level abstractions for state management
  * React provides `useReducer` for redux style dispatch + many others...

---

# Functions, the ultimate abstraction?

* Hooks API is crude, but mind-blowingly simple, it's staggering it took so long to reach this point

* The simplicity has me reflecting on whether you need a more sophisticated architecture to deal with state management

* Can we simply use React directly from Cljs, or do we an abstraction on the abstraction?

---

# Hooks in Cljs (prior art)

* hx
  * Has its own Hiccup implementation
  * Some smarts in how it wraps React, (`useValue`, `useState`) but possibly overkill?
  * Relies to heavily on other React state management constructs (useContext, useReducer) - where Cljs has a better answer to state management.
  * Syntactic sugar of defcomponent macro unnecessary, just use a fn (imo)

* uix
  * Atom as an interface on top of `useState` wrong/unnecessary abstraction

---

# Om classic -> hooks migration (goals)

* Track as close to React as possible
* Try to avoid writing yet another library
* Only add abstractions where they are needed (ratoms)
* Try to do it in ~30 LOC wrapping React
* Keep same fundamental abstractions as before (avoid complete rewrite)
  * Hiccup
  * Global app state

---

# Before and after...

Om classic

```clojure
(defn modal [{:keys [eid admin visible? page om/next user]} owner]
  (reify
    om/IInitState
    (init-state [_] {:event nil})

    om/IDidMount
    (did-mount [_]
      (let [{:keys [dispatch-event]} (next/get-computed owner)]
        (om/set-state! owner :event
                       (ev/listen js/window goog.events.EventType.KEYDOWN
                                  (fn [e]
                                    (when (= 27 (.-keyCode e))
                                      (dispatch-event [:admin/close-modal])))))))

    om/IWillUnmount
    (will-unmount [_]
      (when-let [{:keys [event]} (om/get-state owner)]
        (ev/unlistenByKey event)))

    om/IRender
    (render [_]
      (let [{:keys [ident errors comment?] :as form} (get-in admin [:forms eid])]
        (bs/modal {:header        ....
                   :visible?      visible?
                   :close-button? false}
      ...)
```

---

Hooks

```clojure
(defn modal [props]
  (let [{:keys [eid visible?]} (dom/props props) ;; Things that are genuine props
        admin (db/admin) ;; A 'sub' that need to access data from global app state
        {:keys [ident errors comment?] :as form} (get-in admin [:forms eid])]

    (rehook/use-effect ;; Previously lifecycle events
     (fn []
       (let [ev (ev/listen js/window goog.events.EventType.KEYDOWN
                           (fn [e]
                             (when (= 27 (.-keyCode e))
                               ;; `dispatch-event` becomes a 'global'
                               (dispatch-event [:admin/close-modal]))))]
         #(ev/unlistenByKey ev)))
     [])

    (html
     (el-> bs/modal ;; el-> a fn that wraps react/createElement
           ;; Props a js obj, with "props" key used by `dom/props` call
           #js {"props" {:header        ...
                         :visible?      visible?
                         :close-button? false}}
      ...)
```
